# DrawingProject
A simple drawing program

## Purpose
This was literally just a Java program I'm writing for the practice. Don't actually try to use it to draw anything, because it will be overly cumbersome, and it most certainly won't meet your needs.

## Status
### Work In Progress
Nothing's done.

Backend is functional, but is missing a bunch of stuff, and is still a mess.

Frontend barely even exists.
