# drawing-project
A simple drawing program

## Purpose
This was literally just a Java program I'm writing for the practice. Don't actually try to use it to draw anything, because it will be overly cumbersome, and it most certainly won't meet your needs.

## Status
### Finished
Backend is functional.

Frontend barely even exists. I probably won't even be making one.
